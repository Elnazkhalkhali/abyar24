# ðŸŒ¿ Abyar24

Abyar24 is a simple front-end project built using HTML and CSS, designed as a UI layout for a smart irrigation or agriculture-related service.
In this project, the equipment page for the Abyar 24 site was created (there may be changes in the future) and I had a good collaboration with the company "Sepidyar Hesab Arad".
